Just like development of software has a lifecycle,\nTesting too has a lifecycle\nRequirement Analysis\nThe QA team will interact with various stakeholders (Client, Business Analyst,\nTechnical Leads, System Architects etc.) to understand the requirements in detail.\nTest Planning\nTest Planning is most important phase of Software testing life cycle where all testing strategy is\ndefined.\nHow to prepare Test Plan & Strategy?\nTest Case Development:\nThis is the phase of STLC where testing team write down the detailed test cases. Along with test\ncases testing team also prepare the test data if any required for testing. Once the test cases are\nready then these test cases are reviewed by peer members or QA lead.\nAlso, the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is prepared. The Requirement Traceability\nMatrix is an industry-accepted format for tracking requirements where each test case is\nmapped with the requirement. Using this RTM, we can track backward & forward\ntraceability.\nTest Environment Setup\nTest environment decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is\ntested. Test environment set-up is one of the critical aspects of testing process\nTest Execution\nDuring this phase, the testers will carry out the testing based on the test plans and the test\ncases prepared. Bugs will be reported back to the development team for correction and\nretesting will be performed.\nTest Closure Activities\nTest closure activities are done mostly after the product is delivered\nTest closure activities mainly comprise of four types:\nEnsure Test Completion\nHandover Test Artifacts\nProject Retrospectives\nArchive Test Work Products\nWhat is Test Plan?\nTest plan is a document which contains the plan related to all testing activities which needs to\nbe done to deliver a quality product.\nThis document is prepared after analyzing Business requirements of the Project\nIt is usually prepared by the Test Lead or Senior QA in Agile team\nThe focus of the document is to describe\nwhat to test, (In Scope for testing)\nwhat cannot be tested,\nTools used for Testing, Environments/Infrastructure required to Test\nStaffing and Training Needs\nTesting Duration\nRisks and contingencies plan\nBusiness Requirements:\nReq 1: Submit the Form\nReq 2: Navigate to the tabs present on home page\nReq 3: select the products and add to cart\nReq 4: Added items in cart should display in Checkout page\nReq 5: Select the country to deliver before Purchase\nReq 6: Complete purchase by providing payment details and generate receipt"))}d.isMDXComponent=!0},7967:(e,t,n)=>{n.d(t,{Z:()=>r});const r=n.p+"assets/images/Waterfall-2941b66a88dc6d298bda5d5abe388b06.png"}}]);
