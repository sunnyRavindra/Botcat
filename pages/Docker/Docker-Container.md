1. Containers are runtime instances created from Docker images.
2. They provide a lightweight and isolated environment for running applications.
3. Containers are created using the instructions specified in the Dockerfile and the layers from the corresponding Docker image.
4. Each container has its own filesystem, processes, and network interface, which are isolated from the host system and other containers.
5. Containers allow for consistent application execution across different computing environments.
6. They provide portability and reproducibility, ensuring that applications run reliably regardless of the underlying infrastructure.
7. Containers are scalable and can be easily deployed and managed in orchestration platforms like Kubernetes.
8. They offer resource efficiency by sharing the host system's kernel, reducing overhead compared to traditional virtualization.
9. Containers are ideal for deploying microservices-based architectures and enabling containerized application development.
10. Docker provides tools and APIs to manage and orchestrate containers, making it easy to deploy, scale, and monitor containerized applications.
