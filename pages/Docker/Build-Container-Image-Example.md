```
# Use an official Python runtime as the base image
FROM python:3.9-slim-buster

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the dependencies file to the working directory
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install the dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose a port (optional)
EXPOSE 8000

# Define the command to run the application
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```
1. above example uses the official Python 3.9 slim-buster image as the base.
2. Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.
3. Copies the requirements.txt file from the host to the working directory in the container.
4. Installs the dependencies listed in requirements.txt using pip.
5. Copies the entire application code from the host to the working directory in the container.
6. Optionally exposes port 8000 to allow incoming connections (adjust the port number as needed).
7. Sets the command to run the application using the CMD instruction, which in this case runs the app.py script with Python.
