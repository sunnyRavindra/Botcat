1. An image in Docker is a read-only template containing instructions for creating a Docker container.
2. Images are often based on other images, allowing for customization and additional layers.
3. For example, an image can be based on the Ubuntu image and include the Apache web server, application, and necessary configurations.
4. Images can be created by individuals or obtained from registries where they are published by others.
5. To build a custom image, a Dockerfile is used, which defines the steps to create and run the image.
6. Each instruction in a Dockerfile creates a layer in the image, allowing for incremental and efficient updates.
7. When changes are made to the Dockerfile and the image is rebuilt, only the affected layers are rebuilt, making images lightweight and fast.
8. Docker images are designed to be smaller and more efficient compared to other virtualization technologies.
9. Images serve as a basis for creating and running containers, providing a consistent environment for applications.
