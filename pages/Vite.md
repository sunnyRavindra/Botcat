1. Before [[ES modules]] were available in browsers, developers had no native mechanism for authoring JavaScript in a modularized fashion.
   
2. This is why we are all familiar with the concept of "bundling": using tools that crawl, process, and concatenate our source modules into files that can run in the browser.
   - "Bundling" refers to the process of combining multiple JavaScript modules into a single file (bundle) that the browser can understand.
   - Developers used bundling tools like webpack, Rollup, and Parcel to bundle their code, making it compatible with older browsers that didn't support ES modules.

3. As we build more ambitious applications, the amount of JavaScript we are dealing with is increasing dramatically.
   - With the increasing complexity of frontend applications, the volume of JavaScript code being used has grown significantly.

4. It is not uncommon for large-scale projects to contain thousands of modules.
   - In large projects, it is not unusual to have thousands of individual JavaScript modules or files that make up the application.

5. We are starting to hit a performance bottleneck for JavaScript-based tooling.
   - The increasing size and complexity of projects have led to performance issues with existing JavaScript-based build tools.

6. It can often take an unreasonably long wait (sometimes up to minutes!) to spin up a dev server.
   - Starting a development server with existing tools can be time-consuming, leading to long waiting times, especially for larger projects.

7. File edits can take a couple of seconds to be reflected in the browser, even with Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
   - Even with features like Hot Module Replacement, which allows for faster updates of modified code during development, there can still be noticeable delays in reflecting changes in the browser.

8. The slow feedback loop can greatly affect developers' productivity and happiness.
   - The delays in server startup and code updates can negatively impact developers' productivity and overall satisfaction with the development process.

9. Vite aims to address these issues by leveraging new advancements in the ecosystem: the availability of native ES modules in the browser and the rise of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages.
   - Vite, as a frontend build tool, aims to solve the performance issues by taking advantage of two factors:
     - The availability of native ES modules in modern browsers, which eliminates the need for traditional bundling.
     - The emergence of JavaScript tools written in compile-to-native languages, which can provide faster and more efficient tooling for building frontend applications.
