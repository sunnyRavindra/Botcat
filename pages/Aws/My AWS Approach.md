## Design solutions for Organisational Complexities
#### [[AWS Network]] connectivity strategies
1. On Prem Networking
2. Hybrid Networking
3. Networking between onprem and AWS datacenters
4. Networking between VPC from different Regions and different Accounts 
5. Traffic flow from private to public 

Basic Requirements of a good networking:
1. Communicate with each other.
2. Align with your Security architecture.
3. Be Reliable.
4. Be Resilient.
5. Be cost Optimized.

AWS Global Infrastructure:
1. Regions 
2. Availability Zones
3. Local Zones
4. Edge Locations
5. Regional Edge cache
