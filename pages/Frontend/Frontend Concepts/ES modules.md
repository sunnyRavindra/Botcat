- Prior to the introduction of ES modules, developers relied on other mechanisms like CommonJS or AMD (Asynchronous Module Definition) to modularize their JavaScript code. These mechanisms required the use of additional tools and bundlers to combine and package the modules for the browser.

- However, starting with ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), the JavaScript language introduced native support for modules through the `import` and `export` syntax. This allowed developers to write JavaScript code in a more modular and organized manner directly in their files.

- Unfortunately, during the initial stages of ES module support, web browsers did not immediately provide native support for loading and executing ES modules. Instead, developers had to rely on bundlers like [[webpack]], [[Rollup]], or [[Parcel]] to transpile and bundle their ES module-based code into a format that browsers could understand.

- In recent years, most modern browsers have started to support native ES modules, allowing developers to directly use the `import` and `export` syntax in their JavaScript code without the need for bundling or transpilation. This native support provides benefits such as faster loading times, better caching, and improved browser compatibility.
