To add all files in a Git repository except for a few specific files, you can use the following command:

```bash
git add --all :^<file1> :^<file2>
```

Replace `<file1>` and `<file2>` with the names of the files you want to exclude from being added. You can specify multiple files to exclude by adding more `:^<filename>` options.

For example, to add all files in the repository except for `file1.txt` and `file2.txt`, you can use:

```bash
git add --all :^file1.txt :^file2.txt
```

This command will stage all changes in the repository, excluding the specified files.
