To push your local project files to your GitHub repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize Git:
   Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the root folder of your project. Then, initialize a Git repository by running the following command:

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. Add Files to the Staging Area:
   Use the following command to add all your project files to the staging area:

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

   This command adds all files and directories in the current directory to the staging area. If you want to add specific files, you can specify their names instead of using `.`.

3. Commit Changes:
   Create a commit with a meaningful message that describes the changes you made. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Your commit message here"
   ```

4. Add Remote Repository:
   Link your local repository to the GitHub repository by adding a remote. Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of your GitHub repository. Use the following command:

   ```bash
   git remote add origin <repository-url>
   ```

5. Push to GitHub:
   Finally, push your local commits to the GitHub repository using the following command:

   ```bash
   git push -u origin master
   ```

   This command pushes the commits from your local `master` branch to the `origin` remote repository on GitHub. If you are working on a different branch, replace `master` with the appropriate branch name.

After executing these steps, your project files should be successfully pushed to your GitHub repository. You can verify this by visiting your repository on GitHub and checking if the files are updated.
