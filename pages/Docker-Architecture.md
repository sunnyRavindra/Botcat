1. Docker uses a client-server architecture.
2. The Docker client interacts with the Docker daemon.
3. The Docker daemon performs tasks such as building, running, and distributing Docker containers.
4. The Docker client and daemon can be on the same system or connected remotely.
5. Communication between the Docker client and daemon occurs through a REST API.
6. The communication can take place over UNIX sockets or a network interface.
7. Docker Compose is another client that allows working with applications consisting of multiple containers.
8. Docker Compose helps manage the configuration and deployment of multi-container applications.
