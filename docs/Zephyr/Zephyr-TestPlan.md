### TestPlan

Test plans (groups of test cycles) are used to track testing progress throughout an entire release or version. You can link several test cycles to a test plan and get real-time progress reports when you need them. Test plan fields are customizable, which allows you to track scope, risk, strategy, entry and exit criteria, test environment, test bed, and more.
