### Standard workflow usage
Standard workflows are ideal for long-running, auditable workflows, as they show execution history and visual debugging. 

### Express workflow usage
Express workflows are ideal for high-event-rate workloads, such as streaming data processing and IoT data ingestion.

### Standard workflows specifications
    1. 2,000 per second execution rate

    2. 4,000 per second state transition rate

    3. Priced by state transition

    4. Show execution history and visual debugging

    5. Support all service integrations and patterns

### Express workflows specifications
    1. 100,000 per second execution rate

    2. Nearly unlimited state transition rate

    3. Priced by number and duration of executions

    4. Send execution history to Amazon CloudWatch

    5. Show execution history and visual debugging based on the Log level enabled

    6. Support all service integrations and most patterns
