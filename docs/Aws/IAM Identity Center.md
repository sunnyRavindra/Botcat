- Previously AWS Single Sign-On
- Workforce identities
- Application assignments for SAML applications
    With application assignments, you can grant your workforce users in IAM Identity Center single sign-on access to SAML 2.0 applications, such as Salesforce and Microsoft 365. Your users can access these applications in a single place, without the need for you to set up separate federation.

- Identity Center enabled applications
    AWS applications and services, such as Amazon Managed Grafana, Amazon Monitron, and Amazon SageMaker Studio Notebooks, discover and connect to IAM Identity Center automatically to receive sign-in and user directory services. This provides users with a consistent single sign-on experience to these applications with no additional configuration of the applications. Because the applications share a common view of users, groups, and group membership, users also have a consistent experience when sharing application resources with others.

- Multi-account permissions

- AWS access portal
    The AWS access portal provides your workforce users with one-click access to all their assigned AWS accounts and cloud applications through a simple web portal.
