title: Load vs Stress Testing
---

### Load Testing:
- **Purpose:** Load Testing is a type of performance testing that assesses how a system or application performs under normal or expected load conditions.
- **Scope:** It involves testing the system with a specific load level that simulates typical user activity and usage patterns.
- **Objectives:** The primary goal of load testing is to ensure that the system can handle its expected load without performance degradation.
- **Test Conditions:** Load tests may include concurrent user actions, data input, or transaction processing typical of regular system usage.
- **Performance Metrics:** Load testing measures performance indicators such as response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
- **Benefits:** Load testing helps identify performance bottlenecks and capacity limitations, allowing for optimization before deployment.

### Stress Testing:
- **Purpose:** Stress Testing is a type of performance testing that evaluates how a system behaves under extreme conditions, beyond its normal operational limits.
- **Scope:** It involves testing the system with higher-than-expected load levels or by deliberately overloading it.
- **Objectives:** The primary goal of stress testing is to identify the system's breaking point or to observe how it behaves under exceptional conditions.
- **Test Conditions:** Stress tests may include sudden spikes in user activity, excessive data loads, or resource exhaustion scenarios.
- **Performance Metrics:** Stress testing may focus on assessing the system's behavior during and after a stress event, looking for issues like crashes or data corruption.
- **Benefits:** Stress testing helps identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the system, enabling proactive mitigation and disaster recovery planning.

### Key Differences:
- Load testing assesses how a system performs under expected or typical load conditions, while stress testing evaluates its behavior under extreme and abnormal conditions.
- Load testing is primarily concerned with ensuring performance under normal user activity, while stress testing seeks to find the system's limits and how it behaves when those limits are exceeded.
- Load testing helps optimize the system for expected traffic, while stress testing helps identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the face of unexpected events or extreme usage.

In summary, load testing ensures that a system can handle typical loads, while stress testing explores how the system behaves under extreme conditions or unexpected events. Both types of testing are essential for assessing a system's robustness and performance under different scenarios.
