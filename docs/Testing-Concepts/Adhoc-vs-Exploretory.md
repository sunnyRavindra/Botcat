title: Adhoc vs Exploretory
---
### Ad-hoc Testing
- **Purpose:** Ad-hoc testing is an informal, unscripted approach to testing where testers explore the application without any predefined test cases or plans. The primary goal is to find defects and understand the system's behavior quickly.
- **Scope:** Ad-hoc testing is not structured and does not follow a specific test script or test case. Testers rely on their experience and intuition to uncover issues in the software.
- **Execution Time:** Ad-hoc testing can be performed at any stage of the testing process. It is often used for quick, unplanned checks to identify issues that might have been missed during structured testing.

### Exploratory Testing
- **Purpose:** Exploratory testing is a testing approach where testers simultaneously design and execute test cases based on their real-time understanding of the application. It is a dynamic and flexible way of exploring the software.
- **Scope:** In exploratory testing, testers create test cases on the fly, using their domain knowledge and experience to investigate the application thoroughly. The focus is on uncovering defects, understanding the system's behavior, and identifying risks.
- **Execution Time:** Exploratory testing can be performed throughout the testing process. Testers adapt their testing approach based on what they discover as they explore the application.

In summary, both ad-hoc testing and exploratory testing are unscripted, informal testing approaches that rely on the tester's intuition and experience. Ad-hoc testing is often unplanned and used to quickly identify issues, while exploratory testing is a more structured approach where testers design and execute test cases in real-time to gain a deeper understanding of the software's behavior and uncover defects.
