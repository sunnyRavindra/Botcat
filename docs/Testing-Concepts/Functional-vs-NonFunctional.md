title: Functional vs Non Functional
---
Functional Testing and Non-Functional Testing are two essential categories of software testing, each serving a distinct purpose. Here are notes about both types of testing:

### Functional Testing
- **Purpose:** Functional Testing is focused on verifying that the software's functions work as intended and conform to the specified requirements. It aims to ensure that the system performs its intended operations correctly.
- **Scope:** Functional Testing tests the application's features, such as user interfaces, data processing, business logic, and functionality. It is concerned with "what" the software should do.
- **Test Cases:** Test cases in functional testing are designed based on the functional specifications and use cases, checking whether the software meets the expected behavior and produces correct outputs.
- **Types:** Common types of functional testing include Unit Testing, Integration Testing, System Testing, and Acceptance Testing. Each type of functional testing covers different levels of the application, from individual units to the entire system.

### Non-Functional Testing
- **Purpose:** Non-Functional Testing focuses on evaluating the non-functional aspects of software, such as performance, usability, security, and reliability. It assesses how well the system performs its operations under different conditions.
- **Scope:** Non-Functional Testing addresses "how" the software operates, considering attributes like speed, efficiency, user experience, security, and scalability.
- **Test Cases:** Test cases in non-functional testing are designed to measure and assess the qualities mentioned above. These test cases do not typically involve functionality but rather focus on metrics and characteristics of the software.
- **Types:** Non-Functional Testing includes various types, such as Performance Testing (including load, stress, and scalability testing), Usability Testing, Security Testing, Reliability Testing, and Compatibility Testing. Each type assesses specific non-functional attributes of the software.

### Key Differences
- Functional testing ensures that the software performs its intended functions correctly, while non-functional testing assesses how well the software operates under various conditions.
- Functional testing focuses on specific features and functionality, while non-functional testing evaluates characteristics like performance, security, and user experience.
- Test cases in functional testing check what the software should do, while test cases in non-functional testing assess how well it does it.
- Both types of testing are essential for comprehensive quality assurance, as they ensure that the software not only functions correctly but also meets the necessary performance, security, and user experience standards.

In summary, functional testing concentrates on the features and functionality of the software, whereas non-functional testing evaluates non-functional attributes like performance, usability, and security. Both types of testing are vital to ensuring that the software meets user expectations and quality standards.
