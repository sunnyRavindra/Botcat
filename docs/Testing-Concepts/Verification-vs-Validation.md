title: Priority vs Severity
---

### Bug
- **Priority (Bug):** Priority for a bug determines the order in which the bug should be fixed, based on its importance and impact. For example, "High" priority bugs need to be addressed immediately, "Medium" priority bugs can be addressed after high-priority ones, and "Low" priority bugs can be deferred.
- **Severity (Bug):** Severity characterizes the seriousness of the bug, taking into account its potential impact on the system or users. For instance, "Critical" severity bugs are show-stoppers that render the system unusable, "Major" severity bugs significantly affect functionality, and "Minor" severity bugs have minimal impact.

### Test Case
- **Priority (Test Case):** Priority for a test case determines the order in which the test case should be executed during testing. "High" priority test cases are executed early to verify critical functionalities, "Medium" priority test cases are important but not critical, and "Low" priority test cases are executed later for less critical features.
- **Severity (Test Case):** Severity for a test case characterizes the criticality of the scenario it covers. "Critical" severity test cases are essential for the system to function properly, "Major" severity test cases are important but not show-stoppers, and "Minor" severity test cases cover non-critical or cosmetic aspects.

### User Story (Agile Development):
- **Priority (User Story):** Priority for a user story in an Agile context determines its importance and order in the product backlog. It guides the development team on which stories to work on next. For example, "High" priority user stories are essential for the next sprint, "Medium" priority stories are important but not urgent, and "Low" priority stories can be addressed later.
- **Severity (User Story):** In the context of user stories, severity might not be a commonly used term. Instead, user stories often focus on the value they bring to the user or the business, which can be labeled as "High Value," "Medium Value," or "Low Value."

In Agile development, user stories are typically prioritized based on business value, customer needs, and other factors, and the concept of severity is not as relevant as in the context of testing. However, user stories can still be assigned a priority to determine their order of implementation in an Agile backlog.
