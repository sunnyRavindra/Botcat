### The Same Origin Policy Issue

[SOP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Same-origin_policy)
  Same Origin policy prohibits JavaScript code from accessing elements from a domain that is different from where it was launched. 
Example, the HTML code in www.google.com uses a JavaScript program “randomScript.js”. 
The same origin policy will only allow randomScript.js to access pages within google.com such as google.com/mail, google.com/login, or google.com/signup. However, 
it cannot access pages from different sites such as yahoo.com/search or guru99.com because they belong to different domains.
