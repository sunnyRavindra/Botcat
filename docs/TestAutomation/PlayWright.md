### Resilient â€¢ No flaky tests

**Auto-wait.** Playwright waits for elements to be actionable prior to performing actions. It also has a rich set of introspection events. The combination of the two eliminates the need for artificial timeouts - the primary cause of flaky tests.

**Web-first assertions.** Playwright assertions are created specifically for the dynamic web. Checks are automatically retried until the necessary conditions are met.

**Multiple everything.** Test scenarios that span multiple **tabs**, multiple **origins** and multiple **users**. Create scenarios with different contexts for different users and run them against your server, all in one test.

**Test frames, pierce Shadow DOM.** Playwright selectors pierce shadow DOM and allow entering frames seamlessly.

**Log in once.** Save the authentication state of the context and reuse it in all the tests. This bypasses repetitive log-in operations in each test, yet delivers full isolation of independent tests.

### Powerful Tooling

**[Codegen.](https://playwright.dev/docs/codegen)** Generate tests by recording your actions. Save them into any language.

**[Playwright inspector.](https://playwright.dev/docs/debug#playwright-inspector)** Inspect page, generate selectors, step through the test execution, see click points, explore execution logs.

**[Trace Viewer.](https://playwright.dev/docs/trace-viewer-intro)** Capture all the information to investigate the test failure. Playwright trace contains test execution screencast, live DOM snapshots, action explorer, test source, and many more.

### Important Commands
```
yarn create playwright // Create Project
yarn playwright test // Run Test
yarn playwright show-report // Run Report Server
yarn playwright test --ui // Debut test in UI mode
yarn playwright test --project webkit --project firefox # Overrride Browser
yarn playwright test tests/todo-page/ tests/landing-page/ # Run Specific tests

```

### Basic Test 
```Typescript
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test';

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {  
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/);
});

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {  
await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click();
await expect(page.getByRole('heading', { name: 'Installation' })).toBeVisible();
});
```

### Hooks 
`test.beforeEach` and `test.afterEach` which are executed before/after each test. Other hooks include the `test.beforeAll` and `test.afterAll`

### Codegen

npx playwright codegen demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
```

### Trace Viewer
```
npx playwright test --trace on
```

### Test Configuration

  // Run all tests in parallel.
  fullyParallel: true,

  // Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.only in the source code.
  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,

  // Retry on CI only.
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,

  // Opt out of parallel tests on CI.
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,

  // Reporter to use
  reporter: 'html',

  use: {
    // Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`.
    baseURL: 'http://127.0.0.1:3000',

    // Collect trace when retrying the failed test.
    trace: 'on-first-retry',

  // Configure projects for major browsers.
  projects: [
    {
