If your Git push is trying to commit `node_modules` even though the `node_modules` folder is not present in your Git repository, it may be due to the presence of the `node_modules` entry in the Git cache. To fix this issue, you can follow these steps:

1. Remove the `node_modules` entry from the Git cache using the following command:

   ```bash
   git rm -r --cached node_modules
   ```

   This command removes the `node_modules` entry from the Git cache without deleting the actual `node_modules` folder from your local file system.

2. Create or update your `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your Git repository to ensure that `node_modules` is ignored. Add the following line to your `.gitignore` file:

   ```
   node_modules/
   ```

   This will prevent Git from tracking and committing the `node_modules` folder in the future.

3. Commit the changes to your repository, including the removal of the `node_modules` entry from the cache and the updated `.gitignore` file:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Remove node_modules from Git cache and update .gitignore"
   ```

4. Now, when you push your changes, Git should no longer attempt to commit the `node_modules` folder.

It's important to note that the above steps will only prevent the `node_modules` folder from being committed in future commits. If the `node_modules` folder was previously committed, it will still be present in the Git history. To completely remove `node_modules` from your Git history, you would need to perform a more advanced operation like Git history rewriting, such as using the `git filter-branch` command. However, be cautious when rewriting Git history, as it can have implications for you and other collaborators working on the repository.
