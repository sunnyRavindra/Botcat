   - Rebase is a Git operation that moves or reapplies commits from one branch onto another branch. It essentially modifies the commit history of the branch being rebased.
   - It's useful when you want to incorporate the latest changes from a source branch onto a target branch, making the commit history linear and cleaner.
   - Here's how you can perform a rebase:
     1. Switch to the branch where you want to apply the changes (`git checkout <target-branch>`).
     2. Run the rebase command (`git rebase <source-branch>`), where `<source-branch>` is the branch containing the latest changes you want to apply.
     3. Git will calculate the changes introduced in the source branch and apply them on top of the target branch.
     4. If there are any conflicts, you'll need to manually resolve them as Git applies each commit.
     5. After resolving conflicts (if any), continue the rebase process (`git rebase --continue`) until all commits are applied.
     6. Once the rebase is complete, you'll have a linear commit history on the target branch.
