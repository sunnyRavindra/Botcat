### Test Pyramid
The Test Pyramid strategy is designed to guide software development teams on how to structure their automated testing efforts efficiently by categorizing tests into three layers, forming a pyramid-like shape. The goal is to achieve a balanced approach to testing while ensuring thorough coverage and faster feedback.

The three layers of the Test Pyramid are:

1. Unit Tests (Base of the Pyramid):
   - Unit tests are the foundation of the pyramid and should form the majority of your automated tests.
   - These tests focus on verifying the smallest units of code, such as individual functions or methods.
   - Unit tests are fast to execute, easy to maintain, and provide immediate feedback to developers.
   - They help catch and fix bugs early in the development process, ensuring code correctness at the lowest level.

2. Integration Tests (Middle of the Pyramid):
   - Integration tests validate the interactions and integration between various components or modules of the software.
   - These tests check how different units work together and whether they communicate correctly.
   - Integration tests are broader in scope than unit tests but more focused than end-to-end tests.
   - They help uncover issues related to data flow, communication, and system integration.

3. End-to-End Tests (Top of the Pyramid):
   - End-to-end tests, also known as UI tests or acceptance tests, validate the functionality of the entire application from the user's perspective.
   - These tests simulate real user interactions with the application, including user interface interactions and workflows.
   - End-to-end tests are the slowest and most brittle of the three layers, making them the most expensive to maintain and execute.
   - They are essential for ensuring that the entire application functions correctly and that all components work together seamlessly.

The key principles of the Test Pyramid strategy are as follows:
- Prioritize writing a large number of fast and reliable unit tests to cover the majority of your codebase.
- Use integration tests to validate that components and modules interact correctly.
- Limit the number of end-to-end tests to focus on critical user scenarios and workflows.

The Test Pyramid strategy helps strike a balance between test coverage, execution speed, and maintenance efforts. By emphasizing unit tests at the base of the pyramid, teams can catch and fix defects early in the development process, resulting in more robust and maintainable software. Integration and end-to-end tests serve as safety nets to ensure that the application functions correctly as a whole, without sacrificing the efficiency of the testing process.
