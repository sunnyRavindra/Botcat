title: Blackbox vs Whitebox
---
Black Box Testing and White Box Testing are two distinct approaches to software testing, each with its own focus and purpose. Here are notes about both types of testing:

### Black Box Testing
- **Purpose:** Black Box Testing is a testing approach that focuses on evaluating the functionality of a software application without examining its internal code, structure, or logic. Testers treat the software as a "black box" and assess it based on its inputs, outputs, and behavior.
- **Scope:** Black Box Testing is concerned with testing the software from the user or end-user perspective. It assesses whether the software functions as expected and delivers the desired results without understanding the internal workings.
- **Test Cases:** Test cases in black box testing are designed based on requirements, specifications, or user stories. Testers validate that the software performs the correct functions and produces the expected outputs.
- **Types:** Common types of black box testing include Functional Testing, Non-Functional Testing (e.g., usability, performance, security), and Acceptance Testing.

### White Box Testing
- **Purpose:** White Box Testing, also known as Glass Box Testing or Structural Testing, examines the internal structure, code, and logic of the software application. Testers assess how well the code is written and whether it meets coding standards and design specifications.
- **Scope:** White Box Testing focuses on the internal workings of the software, including code paths, statements, and data flows. Testers assess the logical aspects of the software to identify coding errors, vulnerabilities, and areas that need improvement.
- **Test Cases:** Test cases in white box testing are designed based on knowledge of the internal code structure. Testers assess code coverage, branch conditions, and logical paths to ensure thorough testing of the software's logic.
- **Types:** White Box Testing includes techniques like Statement Coverage, Branch Coverage, Path Coverage, and Code Review.

### Key Differences
- Black Box Testing assesses the software's functionality from a user's perspective, while White Box Testing examines the internal code and structure of the software.
- Black Box Testers do not need knowledge of the internal code, whereas White Box Testers require in-depth knowledge of the code to design test cases.
- Test cases in Black Box Testing are based on requirements and specifications, while test cases in White Box Testing focus on code coverage and logical paths.
- Both types of testing are essential, with Black Box Testing ensuring that the software meets user requirements and White Box Testing verifying the quality of the code and logic.

In summary, Black Box Testing evaluates the functionality of the software without considering its internal code, while White Box Testing examines the internal structure, logic, and code of the software to ensure it is well-structured and adheres to coding standards. Both types of testing are integral to ensuring software quality and reliability.
