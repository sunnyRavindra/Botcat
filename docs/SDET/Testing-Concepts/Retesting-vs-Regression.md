title: Retesting vs Regression Testing
---

### Retesting
- **Purpose:** Retesting is a type of testing that focuses on verifying that a specific defect, which was found and fixed in a previous testing phase, has been successfully rectified. The primary goal is to ensure that the reported issue no longer exists.
- **Scope:** Retesting is narrow in scope and typically involves executing the same test cases that initially revealed the defect. It doesn't explore new areas of the application, focusing solely on the fixed issue.
- **Execution Time:** Retesting is performed after the defect has been fixed, and it aims to validate the resolution quickly. It is a targeted and focused activity.

### Regression Testing
- **Purpose:** Regression testing is a testing approach that aims to ensure that recent changes or new features introduced into the software do not adversely affect existing, stable functionalities. It verifies that the application still works as expected after modifications.
- **Scope:** Regression testing is broader in scope and involves re-running a subset of existing test cases (both related to the changes and critical core functionalities) to detect unintended side effects or regressions.
- **Execution Time:** Regression testing is performed whenever there are code changes, new feature additions, or updates to the application. It's an ongoing process throughout the software development lifecycle.

In summary, retesting and regression testing serve different purposes and have distinct scopes. Retesting is specific to validating the resolution of a known defect, while regression testing is a broader, ongoing effort to ensure that new changes do not introduce unintended issues in the existing, stable areas of the application.
