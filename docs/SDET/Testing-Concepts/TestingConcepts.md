### Test Scenario
   - Definition: A test scenario is a high-level description of a specific function or feature to be tested.
   - Purpose: Test scenarios provide a broad overview of what needs to be tested without going into detailed steps. They help in understanding the scope of testing for a particular feature.
   - Example: A test scenario for a login feature might be "Verify that users can successfully log in using valid credentials."

### Test Case
   - Definition: A test case is a detailed set of conditions, inputs, and expected results that specify how to test a particular aspect of a software application.
   - Purpose: Test cases are specific and actionable instructions for executing tests. They provide step-by-step guidance to testers to verify whether the software functions correctly.
   - Example: A test case for the login feature mentioned earlier might include steps like "Enter valid username and password" and the expected result of "Successfully logged in."

### Test Step
   - Definition: A test step is a single action or instruction within a test case, defining what the tester needs to do and what is expected to happen.
   - Purpose: Test steps break down a test case into individual, discrete actions. They provide a clear, sequential path for the tester to follow.
   - Example: In the test case for the login feature, each step is a test step. For example, "Enter username" and "Enter password" would be individual test steps within the test case.

### Differences
- Test Scenario is high-level and provides an overview, whereas Test Case is detailed and provides specific steps.
- Test Scenario doesn't include specific instructions or expected outcomes, while Test Case provides precise instructions and expected results.
- Test Case consists of multiple Test Steps, which are individual actions to be performed during testing.
- Test Scenarios are typically used for test planning and requirement analysis, while Test Cases are used for actual testing execution.
- Test Scenarios help in creating an initial test plan, while Test Cases ensure systematic and comprehensive testing of specific functionalities.

In summary, test scenarios help you understand what needs to be tested at a high level, test cases provide the detailed steps and expected results for testing, and test steps break down those test cases into individual actions. All three are essential for effective and structured software testing.
