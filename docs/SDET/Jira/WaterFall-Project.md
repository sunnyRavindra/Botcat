Software Testing Life Cycle – STLC
Testing is not only limited just to find bugs but has a wider scope and is required
right from the beginning of the project when the requirements are not even
finalized.
Since testing is also standardized. Just like development of software has a lifecycle,
Testing too has a lifecycle
Requirement Analysis
The QA team will interact with various stakeholders (Client, Business Analyst,
Technical Leads, System Architects etc.) to understand the requirements in detail.
Test Planning
Test Planning is most important phase of Software testing life cycle where all testing strategy is
defined.
How to prepare Test Plan & Strategy?
Test Case Development:
This is the phase of STLC where testing team write down the detailed test cases. Along with test
cases testing team also prepare the test data if any required for testing. Once the test cases are
ready then these test cases are reviewed by peer members or QA lead.
Also, the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is prepared. The Requirement Traceability
Matrix is an industry-accepted format for tracking requirements where each test case is
mapped with the requirement. Using this RTM, we can track backward & forward
traceability.
Test Environment Setup
Test environment decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is
tested. Test environment set-up is one of the critical aspects of testing process
Test Execution
During this phase, the testers will carry out the testing based on the test plans and the test
cases prepared. Bugs will be reported back to the development team for correction and
retesting will be performed.
Test Closure Activities
Test closure activities are done mostly after the product is delivered
Test closure activities mainly comprise of four types:
Ensure Test Completion
Handover Test Artifacts
Project Retrospectives
Archive Test Work Products
What is Test Plan?
Test plan is a document which contains the plan related to all testing activities which needs to
be done to deliver a quality product.
This document is prepared after analyzing Business requirements of the Project
It is usually prepared by the Test Lead or Senior QA in Agile team
The focus of the document is to describe
what to test, (In Scope for testing)
what cannot be tested,
Tools used for Testing, Environments/Infrastructure required to Test
Staffing and Training Needs
Testing Duration
Risks and contingencies plan
