### Scrum Projects


### Kanban Projects

### Waterfall Model

![Waterfall.png](./static/Waterfall.png)

1. Time to market is high
2. Final appliaction might not be what customer wanted. 
3. Changing the requirements midway is difficult.
4. Not suitable for project where requirements keeps on changing.
5. Better Documentation.

### Agile

1. Interaction over tools. 
2. working software over documentation.
3. Customer collaboation over budget negotiation.
4. Responding to change as per plan changes.
5. Delivering software quickly in incremental model.
6. Business folks and Developer works closely.

### Scrum / Sprint

1. Plan
2. Build
3. Test
4. Review

### Sprint Artifacts
1. Product Backlog
2. Sprint Backlog
3. Burn down chart

### Ceremonies 
1. Sprint Planning
2. Scrum Meeting
3. Sprint Review
4. Sprint Retro

### Kanban vs Scrum 
1. No Sprint backlog in Kanban
2. There is no process in Kanban 
3. Scrum has a fixed timeline

### Jira 
1. Jira Project 
2. Systems Dashboard (You can customize your dashboard as you like)
3. Everything in Jira is an Issue.
4. Epic - Major functionality
5. Stories - is defined as what user would want to be able to do after the end of Sprint
6. Task - are assigned to Developer

Epic -> Stories -> Tasks -> Bug

### Issue WorkFlow 
1. New 
2. Work

### Issue Estimates
1. by hours 
2. by story points

### Roles 
1. Global
2. Project Specific roles

### Createing custom issue type called scheme
### Createing custom fileds 
### Createing custom workflows
### Default Assignee can be set too
### Componenets can be created to device the responsibility to specific team (Its exactly like a configuration Item)

### Edge Test cases 





### Jira Introduction

1. Bug Tracking
2. Issue Tracking
3. Project Management
4. Requirements Management
5. HelpDesk
6. Generate Reports
7. Customized Issues 
8. Custome Notifications
9. Powerfull Search functionality
10. Extincible

   AGILE + JIRA :
Agenda:
Tester/Developer day to day role in Agile Scrum Projects
How to Use Jira tool for Project Management and its related activities

We shall assume Credit card online Banking Application to Demonstrate above topics

Features to Develop:
	•	Develop Login Module
	•	Credit card Dashboard 
	•	Profile

Install Jira into Machines



	•	What Constitutes Agile Team?
Product owner,Scrum Master, Development team(Dev,QA,BA)
	•	Create Scrum Project in Jira.
	•	what is epic? An epic user story is a large that cannot be delivered as defined within a single iteration or is large enough that it can be split into smaller user stories
	•	What is User story?
	•	A user story is the smallest unit of work in an agile framework.
	•	Epics are large work items broken down into a set of stories, 
	•	The purpose of a user story is articulate how a piece of work will deliver a particular value back to the customer.
	•	User stories are a few sentences in simple language that outline the desired outcome
	•	Requirements are added later, once agreed upon by the team.
	•	User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:

“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that	
How to create Stories and Epics in JIRA?
What are components and how to create them in JIRA?
What are release versions?




What is backlog refinement/Grooming? And how it is done?
1 week before sprint starts
Have it in the middle of sprint and make stories for next sprint
1 week before Sprint 2 starts 
	•	How to define Acceptance criteria to Story?
	•	Create SubTasks for Story
	•	Size the story based on its complexity












	•	what is Sprint?

Software Testing Life Cycle – STLC
Testing is not only limited just to find bugs but has a wider scope and is required
right from the beginning of the project when the requirements are not even
finalized.
Since testing is also standardized. Just like development of software has a lifecycle,
Testing too has a lifecycle
Requirement Analysis
The QA team will interact with various stakeholders (Client, Business Analyst,
Technical Leads, System Architects etc.) to understand the requirements in detail.
Test Planning
Test Planning is most important phase of Software testing life cycle where all testing strategy is
defined.
How to prepare Test Plan & Strategy?
Test Case Development:
This is the phase of STLC where testing team write down the detailed test cases. Along with test
cases testing team also prepare the test data if any required for testing. Once the test cases are
ready then these test cases are reviewed by peer members or QA lead.
Also, the Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) is prepared. The Requirement Traceability
Matrix is an industry-accepted format for tracking requirements where each test case is
mapped with the requirement. Using this RTM, we can track backward & forward
traceability.
Test Environment Setup
Test environment decides the software and hardware conditions under which a work product is
tested. Test environment set-up is one of the critical aspects of testing process
Test Execution
During this phase, the testers will carry out the testing based on the test plans and the test
cases prepared. Bugs will be reported back to the development team for correction and
retesting will be performed.
Test Closure Activities
Test closure activities are done mostly after the product is delivered
Test closure activities mainly comprise of four types:
Ensure Test Completion
Handover Test Artifacts
Project Retrospectives
Archive Test Work Products
What is Test Plan?
Test plan is a document which contains the plan related to all testing activities which needs to
be done to deliver a quality product.
This document is prepared after analyzing Business requirements of the Project
It is usually prepared by the Test Lead or Senior QA in Agile team
The focus of the document is to describe
what to test, (In Scope for testing)
what cannot be tested,
Tools used for Testing, Environments/Infrastructure required to Test
Staffing and Training Needs
Testing Duration
Risks and contingencies plan
Business Requirements:
Req 1: Submit the Form
Req 2: Navigate to the tabs present on home page
Req 3: select the products and add to cart
Req 4: Added items in cart should display in Checkout page
Req 5: Select the country to deliver before Purchase
