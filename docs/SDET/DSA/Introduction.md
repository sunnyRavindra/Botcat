1. **Linear Data Structures:**
    
    - Elements arranged sequentially.
    - Examples: Array, stack, queue, linked list.
2. **Static Data Structures:**
    
    - Fixed memory size.
    - Example: Array.
3. **Dynamic Data Structures:**
    
    - Size not fixed, can be updated during runtime.
    - Examples: Queue, stack.
4. **Non-linear Data Structures:**
    
    - Elements not placed sequentially.
    - Examples: Trees, graphs.
### Auxiliary
refers to the extra space used in the program other than the input data structure.
### Asymptotic analysis
Method for describing the efficiency of an algorithm.
### Big O Notation (O):
It describes the worst-case scenario for the algorithm's time or space complexity in terms of a mathematical function. For example, O(n) represents linear complexity, O(n^2) represents quadratic complexity, and O(log n) represents logarithmic complexity.
### Omega Notation (Ω):
It describes the best-case scenario for the algorithm's time or space complexity. For example, Ω(n) represents linear complexity.
### Theta Notation (Θ):
Theta notation provides a tight bound on an algorithm's growth rate, both upper and lower bounds. If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(f(n)), it means the algorithm's performance grows exactly at the rate of the function f(n).
