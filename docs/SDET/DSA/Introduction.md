### Algorithm's usage's 

Search − Algorithms to search an item in a datastrucure.

Sort − Algorithms to sort items in certain order

Insert − Algorithm to insert item in a datastructure

Update − Algorithm to update an existing item in a data structure

Delete − Algorithm to delete an existing item from a data structure

### Asymptotic analysis

Method for describing the efficiency of an algorithm.

### Big O Notation (O):
It describes the worst-case scenario for the algorithm's time or space complexity in terms of a mathematical function. For example, O(n) represents linear complexity, O(n^2) represents quadratic complexity, and O(log n) represents logarithmic complexity.

### Omega Notation (Ω):
It describes the best-case scenario for the algorithm's time or space complexity. For example, Ω(n) represents linear complexity.

### Theta Notation (Θ):
Theta notation provides a tight bound on an algorithm's growth rate, both upper and lower bounds. If an algorithm has a time complexity of Θ(f(n)), it means the algorithm's performance grows exactly at the rate of the function f(n).
