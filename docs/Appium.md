    Appium is OS-independent as it relies on a framework to translate Selenium Webdriver commands into UIAutomation for iOS or UIAutomator for Android.
    It is not tied to a specific mobile device OS but adapts commands based on the device type.
    Appium supports various programming languages with Selenium client libraries, including Java, Objective-C, JavaScript with node.js, PHP, Ruby, Python, and C#.
